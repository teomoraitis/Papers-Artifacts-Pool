**Direct Memory Translation for Virtualized Clouds [ASPLOS'24]** (Virtualization)

Direct Memory Translation (DMT) in virtualized environments is becoming increasingly popular, as address translation overhead is more and more expensive. To fight this problem DMT is proposed, which is a hardware-software extension that can minimize the page walk access time. The key idea of DMT is to manage direct mapping from each virtual page to its last-level PTE (Page Table Entry) in memory.

DMT is fully compatible with x86 memory architecture and existing Page Table structures. It is designed to be scalable and practical, so it can be adopted in real-world OS and HW implementations. It results in an average 1.65x speedup of page table walks in a virtualized environment, and 1.24x speedups of application execution.
